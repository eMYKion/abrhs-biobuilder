                <p>
                Chris Kuffner has an eternal grudge against fungus. 
                When he was merely a freshman, an unknown fungus 
                attacked both of his warm, damp, and vulnerable feet. 
                He suffered relentless itching for months and vowed
                that one day he would kill ALL of the fungi.  
                Chris sees potential in synthetic biology as the only
                solution and has spent years leaning to control its 
                dark powers. Now, he eats those sorry mushrooms in his
                lunch and dinner. Chris has focused his vicious hatred 
                on research, searching for a deadly sequence.

                <p>
                 I joined Biobuilder because of my love for biology and
                 interest in genetic engineering. I helped out with 
                 brainstorming, labs, and the website for our project. 
                 I like to play tennis, board games like Settlers of Catan,
                 and of course I love studying biology. Otherwise, I often 
                 play my favorite mobile phone game, Puzzle and Dragons.

                 Rachel wants to be the best like no one ever was. 
                 To configure the DNA sequence was her test, to build
                 proteins was her cause! She travels far and wide, searching
                 for all gene sequence. She ended up at a obscure location in
                 a far off region, and began her journey to learn all about
                 genetic engineering, while testing her knowledge against 8
                 other wise scientist. After defeating them with higher test 
                 scores, she was able to test whether or not she was the greatest
                 scientist in the whole world by facing up the 4 elite scientist
                 in an extreme event of building the most complex genetic engineering
                 project. After beating all four of them, she thought she was the
                 world's greatest scientist, but she realized there was one more
                 scientist greater than her. Gary Oak. She faced him off in an intense
                 engineering competition. Unfortunately, she lost. However, she found
                 a BioBuilder club at ABRHS, and decided to refine her skills there,
                 and re-challenge Gary when her skills grow sharper.

                <h3>Epithet: Anuradha Saini</h3>
                
                To the naked eye, Anuradha Saini  is a shy, fickle
                creature, twitching every couple of seconds among other
                lousy, less sophisticated students. Also known as the
                Supreme Leader, she prefers to be in the company of nerdy
                biologists instead of sweaty jocks. To quench her thirst
                for science, Anuradha decided to join Biobuilder during
                her junior year of high school. Like a flower blooming in
                spring, she blossomed while she held hands with her new
                partner, E.coli. After watching a highly disturbing safety
                video, Anuradha immediately came to the swift conclusion
                that her fellow scientists should not face the wrath of
                bad safety techniques. After she is kicked out of the
                laboratory after Biobuilder meetings, Anuradha prefers to
                spend time among Pokemon: Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
                Her favorite region is Hoenn, the region that is superior
                to all others. Like her perfect comrades, Julia and Madhuri,
                she wishes to become a medical expert one day, even if this
                requires eliminating those close to her.

                <h3>Epithet: Madhuri Jois</h3>
                
                Madhuri Jois, Supreme Dictator, enjoys spending
                her time reflecting on amazing literature and TV
                shows. As a junior exposed to horrible SAT vocab
                lists, she has finally discovered that she is a
                self-proclaimed misanthrope. She has been in BioBuilder
                for two years, but joining the BioBuilder Team was merely
                a way for her to design a super organism that will wipe
                out the human race, a species that she particularly
                despises. One rather fascinating aspect of Madhuri is
                she greatly enjoys eating Dove chocolates and reading
                the profound statements on the wrappers. Madhuri currently
                uses the TV show Avatar: the Last Airbender as a reference
                to appropriate human etiquette. In fear of someday becoming
                a terrifying crotchety cat lady, she would like to make the
                distinction that she would prefer a flying bison as a pet.
                She hopes to go to medical school in her future, which, 
                in this authorâ€™s opinion, is to gain a better understanding
                of the human body in order to properly eviscerate those who annoy her.

                genetic engineering, and came up with an ingenious idea. She remains in the club
                to learn as much as she can about synthetic biology, so that one day the seven kingdoms
                will cower in awe of her knowledge, and she will acquire the iron throne, which is rightfully hers!

                Julia Ma, the Radical Kewl Gerl, spends her
                time running away from her problems and invisible
                zombies. She joined Biobuilder in an attempt to
                create the perfect biological weapon against the zombie menace.
                When sheâ€™s not obsessively pondering over the various
                tactics and strategies of her mortal enemies, she enjoys
                knitting stockings to strangle her enemies with. Currently
                she is a junior in High School and living in her parentsâ€™ basement,
                only emerging to design her bio weapon and stock up on spinach
                and three cheese Hot Pockets. Eventually, once she gets over her
                totally rational fear of invisible zombies and string cheese,
                she hopes to spend the rest of her days becoming a doctor.
                So once the inevitable zombie apocalypse comes around, sheâ€™ll
                be the only one who can take the enemy down from the inside out.
                Julia Ma is a delusional, zombie-obsessed person, and an absolute
