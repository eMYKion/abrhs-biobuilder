            <p>We have been investigating a variety of antifungal proteins for sutability. However, due to the advantages of a short sequence, we focused on antifungal protiens with a length of less than 50 amino acids. Of these, we focused on two classes: the chitin synthesis inhibitors and the glucan synthesis inhibitors, due to the fact that fungal cell wals are made of chitin and glucan.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We found 5 promising protiens that we investigated further, using a discussion by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC89011/">De Lucca et al</a>.</p>

            <p>However, none of these protiens were good candidates for transforming our E. coli bacteria. Many we could not even find the sequences for,
            so we searched for a new possibility.</p>
            <p>For the second time, we did a search of the NCBI database looking for chitinases, since chitin makes up fungal cell walls.
            In it, we restricted ourselves to protiens that met two characteristics:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Less than 500 amino acids in length. We wished our plasmid to be around 5000 total base pairs, as we have had success transforming
                that particular strain of E. coli with plasmids of that length. We had initially looked for protiens with less than 50 base pairs so that they could diffuse out of the E. coli without a seperate release mechanism. 
                As we had had little success, we decided to go with a longer sequence and lyse the cells to release the protien, if necessary.</li>
                <li>Bacterial in origin. We did not want a protein that would kill our E. coli chassis, so we selected a bacterial one to make sure that
                it was not deadly to bacteria</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We came up with one protein that fulfilled all of our requerments: Chitinase D, a 488 base pair protien from Bacillus circulans that attacked N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide (1->4)-beta-linkages in chitin. It had a gene sequence, too. (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC205731/pdf/jbacter00068-0076.pdf"> Watanabe et al</a>)</p>
            <p>Due to its reliability, we decided to go with 'insert plasmid here' for our plasmid. </p>
