            <h1>Safety</h1>
          
             <p>Welcome to the Safety section of the website! Our BioBuilder team always practices safe labratory procedure.</p>
          <p>We take safety very seriously. </p>
          
          <h2>BioBrick Part Safety</h2>
          <p>All our parts are listed under our Research Page by code from the iGEM registry of biological parts. None of these parts pose safety issues.</p>
          <h2>NSTA BioSafety Committee</h2>
          <h2>Following NSTA Regulations</h2>
          <p>Along with following safety regulations of our own, we followed the NSTA (National Science Teacher's Association) guidelines for safe laboratory practices handling microbes. This is a recognized protocol that our school's science department uses for safety in a laboratory experiment.</p>
          <h3>Only handling microorganisms with known sources</h3>
          <p>The only sources for such microorganisms should be from biologicla supply houses or university laboratories. The genus and species name should be known. Microorganisms should never be cultured off one's own body as they potenially are pathogenic.</p>
          <h3>Treating all microorganisms as potential pathogens</h3>
          <p>Any microorgansim may potenially present pathogenic properties. Students with comprised immune systems should not participate in such laboratories. Petri dishes should also not be completely open to the air.</p>
          <h3>Personal protective equipment and hygiene</h3>
          <p>Students should wear safety goggles, aprons, and gloves. Open-toed footware should not be worn, and any lose clothing or hair should be pulled back. Synthetic clothes is preferred as it does not burn as easily as natural materials.</p>
          <h3>Washing hands</h3>
          <p>Hands should be washed before and after laboratory procedures to disinfect skin surfaces.</p>
          <h3>Disinfecting work areas before and after use</h3>
          <p>Either 70% alchohol or 10% bleach should be used to disinfect work areas before and after laboratory steps. Ethanol and any paper towels used to clean up the ethanol should be kept away from hot objects such as burners, so that any fumes do not ignite.</p>
          <h3>Sterilizing equipment</h3>
          <p>An autoclaving procedure should be used to disinfect equipment used before the labs. 70% ethanol and 10% bleach can also be used to sterilize.</p>
          <h3>Never pipetting by mouth</h3>
          <p>Liquid cultures should be transferred by a pipette bulb or a pipetting device.</p>
          <h3>Labeling everything clearly</h3>
          <p>Cultures, media, chemicals, and disinfectants should be clearly marked by name. Any hazardous substances should be clearly marked as well.</p>
