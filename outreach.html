            <h>Science Family Night</h>
            <p>Science family night is a local event where high schoolers share their knowlede of STEM with students in elementary school.
            We set up a fun table that showcased our iGEM project poster from last year along with vita yeast, a GMO that makes vitamin A.
            The vita yeast was displayed in petri dishes and we had a loaf of bread made with the yeast on a plate.
            Families walked up to our stall to hear what biobuilder was all about and we explained the process of modifying the DNA of living organisms.
            At the end of the presentation, we asked the families whether or not they would eat the bread made with the genetically modified yeast.
            Much to our suprise, the vote was almost even, with the "no" side winning by one vote.
